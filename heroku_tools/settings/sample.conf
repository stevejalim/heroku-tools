# ======================================================
# Heroku tool application configuration
#
# This is a sample configuration file showing how to set
# up a single Heroku application for deployments and
# configuration.
#
# Each application you want to deploy using the tool
# must have its own conf file - which will be
# referenced by its name - e.g. if you want to call
# your live application "live", then create a conf
# file called "live.conf".
#
# The `upstream` and `downstream` attributes are used to
# determine how to migrate data (downstream -> upsteam)
# and pipeline deployments (upstream -> downstream)
#
# ======================================================

    # the name of the Heroku application
